## General Info
A movie rental store created using ASP.NET MVC.  
Well, looking through the eyes of a recruiter or a senior dev,  
probably just another useless CRUD app that does not even implement  
Dijkstra'a algorithm or N-Tier Architecture. What is even worse - it is based on some online courses.  
On the other hand, why would it implement such things? It is just a simple rental store that was fun to create and for example  
learn about N + 1 in practice. For me? A fun [lesson learned](#lessons-learned) with some proper guidance.  
If Mosh Hamedani, the author of the course, had not elaborated enough I have books by John Sharp, Dino Esposito and Jon Skeet
in which I could look up the rest. If that was not enough, I turned a few times to Uncle Google and Aunt Stack Overflow.

## Technologies
